# Pattern Language for Knowledge Workers

An evolving collection of patterns to understand, structure, and improve knowledge work.

Patterns are partitioned and sorted from large to small scale. Each is connected to smaller patterns; starting with the larger one provides context first. A larger-scale pattern is considered incomplete as long as the smaller patterns are not yet present; cconversely, implementing a smaller scale pattern requires you to take the larger picture into account.

This is not a linear reading experience, but a network of possible paths. It's like a "choose your own adventure" book where no reading equals another.

I suggest you get an overview of the patterns by skimming each pattern's **problem statement** and **solution**, then research a specific path in more detail once you found out what resonates with you.

# Contributing ‚ù§Ô∏è

In short: _Yes, please!_

## "I have an idea for a cool pattern"

If you have an idea but don't feel like writing about it yourself, **open an issue** and describe the idea. Same for problems you spot.


## "I want to write something myself"

Great!

To submit changes, fork this repository, create a new branch and name it something that tells what you're doing, and **create a pull request.** Here are naming suggestions:

* `fixes` or a simple `patch` (default name when you edit on GitHub) could indicate you're only correcting language or small errors;
* `pattern-XYZ` indicate you want to submit a new pattern.

Pull requests will be open for discussion and merged as soon as everybody's on the same page.
