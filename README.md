# Pattern Language for Knowledge Workers

An evolving collection of patterns to understand, structure, and improve knowledge work.

Patterns are partitioned and sorted from large to small scale. Each is connected to smaller patterns; starting with the larger one provides context first. A larger-scale pattern is considered incomplete as long as the smaller patterns are not yet present; cconversely, implementing a smaller scale pattern requires you to take the larger picture into account.

This is not a linear reading experience, but a network of possible paths. It's like a "choose your own adventure" book where no reading equals another.

I suggest you get an overview of the patterns by skimming each pattern's **problem statement** and **solution**, then research a specific path in more detail once you found out what resonates with you.

# Reading the Book

## Format of a Pattern

0. Title and evidence rating
1. Illustration of the pattern
2. Introductory Paragraph: provide context; how does this pattern help complete larger patterns?
3. Separator for the main part
4. Essence of the pattern, 1--2 sentences
5. Main body of text; description; empirical background; evidence; application
6. Solution in instructional form
7. Diagram
8. Separator, ending the main part
9. Context of smaller patterns to help implement, complete, fill this pattern

### Evidence rating

The number of stars indicate the rating:

1. ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ Speculative: try solution for yourself, but don't just expect this to change your life
2. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ Experimental: next step towards a solution, but no final advice; take advice with a grain of salt
3. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ Solid and true: pattern solves the problem at hand for all common cases

In short: _Yes, please!_

## "I have an idea for a cool pattern"

If you have an idea but don't feel like writing about it yourself, **open an issue** and describe the idea. Same for problems you spot.


## "I want to write something myself"

Great!

To submit changes, fork this repository, create a new branch and name it something that tells what you're doing, and **create a pull request.** Here are naming suggestions:

* `fixes` or a simple `patch` (default name when you edit on GitHub) could indicate you're only correcting language or small errors;
* `pattern-XYZ` indicate you want to submit a new pattern.

Pull requests will be open for discussion and merged as soon as everybody's on the same page.
