# Knowledge Work Design Patterns

## Format of a Pattern

0. Title and evidence rating
1. Picture
2. Introductory Paragraph: context; how does it help complete larger patterns
3. (Separator: main part)
4. Essence (1--2 sentences)
5. Description: empirical background; evidence; application
6. Solution: instructional form
7. Diagram
8. (Separator)
9. Context of smaller patterns to help implement, complete, fill this pattern

## Evidence rating

1. Speculative: try solution for yourself, but don't just expect this to change your life
2. Experimental: next step towards a solution, but no final advice; take advice with a grain of salt
3. Solid and true: pattern solves the problem at hand for all common cases

## Organization of Patterns

* From large to small
    * Each pattern is connected to smaller patterns; starting with the larger one provides context first
    * Also, the top-down approach can help identify parts where you have problems prior to looking for implementation details
    * A larger-scale pattern is considered incomplete as long as the smaller patterns are not yet present
    * Conversely, implementing a smaller scale pattern requires you to take the larger picture into account
* Not a linear reading experience, but a network of possible paths
    * "Choose your own adventure": get an overview of the patterns by skimming the problem statements and solutions, then research a path in more detail
