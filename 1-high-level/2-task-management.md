# Task Management (2) ★★★

<!-- TODO: add image of a task list, task management app, or similar-->

Getting any serious work done requires you have a sufficient amount of free energy. This is important for tasks which employ creativity just as much as it is important for tasks which require a lot of focus on details. A proper task management frees mental energy, an important part of [ENERGY MANAGEMENT (0)](#0energymanagement).

**People keep tasks and appointments in their heads. This occupies mental energy better invested in creative tasks.**

Our brains aren't good at remembering stuff. Of course we are able to recall memories, but when we go buy groceries, we hardly remember all the things we set out to do. This is in part due to the distracting nature of our environment (like ads, pulling at our attention), in part due to the fact that memorizing a list of 10+ items is no easy task in itself:

* The working capacity of our memory is limited; think about the notion that you can hold only something betwee 4 and 9 items in your mind at once.<!-- TODO: back this up with proper references-->
* Otherwise unrelated pieces or chunks of information are pretty boring to our minds.
* Spontaneous stimuli (like a tasty chocolate bar) may create an inner dissonance, resulting in parts of the list getting forgotten: "I want to eat healthy; so I put carrots and grass-fed steak on my list" versus "I really want to indulge in the sensation of melting this heavenly piece of chocolte-based extasy in my mouth." If the chocolate bar wins, you may end up not fetching the carrots.

That's why some smarter person than us had the idea to invent The Grocery List. You can wrangle with your sweet-toothed inner demons for a while _and_ make sure that you don't forget half of your errands due to exhaustion.

Still there are people who commit appointments to memory, for example, trying to program their brains to think "Get up and get going!" at the appropriate time. Since our brains aren't very good at being precice, we end up getting aroused and ready hours before the appointed time. It's the best our body can do. It's also a waste of resources and ruins your focus.

Same with tasks; you know that you have to finish that report by end of next week. You just do. Still you may forget about it for days and remember it just in time to get it done before you have to hand it in, even though you had plenty of time the days before. "Why didn't I think about this yesterday, when I was way less occupied?" -- Although that's not always how things go, this is a likely course of action.

It gets worse: when you don't enjoy the task or appointment at hand, you may be more likely to forget to do it altogether. That's natural procrastination. When you have an internal dissonance like the following, it should be no surprise to you that delegating to remember the task to your subconscious mind will probably result in the longest postponing possible: "I hate writing reports. I have to get this report done by the end of next week. I'd rather not do it at all. There's so much other cool stuff to do."

Our mind is made to be creative; it's not a very accurate timer. Mistaking it for one will result in failure. You will be stressed because you cannot really rely on yourself. Others may rely on you less, too, producing even more stress. Even if you succeed in the end, this takes up lots of your mental resources, think "memory" and "processing power." It's a lose--lose situation.

Therefore: **Externalize all your tasks and appointments on paper, mobile device, or computer, including "fun stuff" to create a system that can accompany you through your whole life -- and not just the boring parts.**

Without a TRUSTED SYSTEM (<!-- TODO: insert link and pattern no. TRUSTED SYSTEM-->), managing tasks is just an idle occupation: you need to find a way you can live by and stop worrying. Then you can free mental energy by taking care of OPEN LOOPS (<!-- TODO: insert link and pattern no. OPEN LOOPS-->) through the use of a UBIQUITUOUS CAPTURING DEVICE (<!-- TODO: insert link and pattern no. UBIQUITUOUS CAPTURING DEVICE -->) combined with proper INBOX (<!-- TODO: insert link and pattern no. INBOX-->) management. The resulting TO-DO LISTS (<!-- TODO: insert link and pattern no. TO-DO LISTS-->) should adhere to the principle of ACTIONABILITY (<!-- TODO: insert link and pattern no. ACTIONABILITY-->) to really help your FUTURE SELF (<!-- TODO: insert link and pattern no. FUTURE SELF -->) get stuff done. You will want to find a CALENDAR (<!-- TODO: insert link and pattern no. CALENDAR-->) that really suits your life's purpose to complete this part of the system.
